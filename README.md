## Project description:

CoPlay is a simple streaming service that lets you upload videos and create a Watch Party - a shareable link where you can watch your video together in real time.

## Problem domain:

- People who live apart want to watch a movie/video together that is playing at the exact same time.

- Many users may be overwhelmed by complicated streaming services, and would like an app that has a minimal amount of pages and requirements.

## User stories:

- As a user, I want to be able to watch movies with my friends at the same time
- I also want to be able to make comments during the movie that my friends can see
- I want the interface to be simple and streamlined
- I want to be able to search by name of genre to find my favourite movie

## Developer stories

- As a developer, I want to add movies easily through the data to be able to retrieve later
- I want the users to be able to log in with ease, retrieving a unique clerk_id to use in our databases.
- I want to have a maintainable codebase that I can understand and update with ease.

- What went really well and what could have gone better?
  Detailing useful external sources that helped you complete the assignment (e.g Youtube tutorials).
